# Welcome to the **Student Freelancing** project of group 3B!

Our system, **Student Freelancing**, was designed to allow TU Delft students to provide services for companies in the Netherlands with ease. <br><br>_Students_ can post the services they want to provide, and _companies_ can search for them by selecting an expertise they are interested in or by specifying certain keywords. If a _company_ is interested in a student then it can submit a service request to them and wait for them to accept or deny it. Also, _companies_ can post a request for services without targeting specific students, and in this case students will be the ones signing up to them. If 2 parties agree on an offer, then the system will generate a _contract_. This contract can be extended, modified and terminated. At the end of the service period, both companies and students can provide _feedback_ about their working experience, which will be visible to all users.

## Description of project

**Student Freelancing** is developed by students from **TU Delft** to make freelancing easier and more accesible. Our system uses a powerful and comprehensive **REST API built with Spring Boot**, and **Eureka + Zuul** for _service discovery_ and _intelligent routing_. It was built **modular** such that it can be extended with extra functionalities later, and as an API it allows for **easy integration with other systems**.

Our project may have reached a working version with all required features implemented, but we're not stopping there! We have a ton of other innovative ideas to add to our system, such as having recommendations, better security (HTTPS, TU Delft SSO, 2FA), and controlling spam. So take it out for a spin and let us know how we can make it your favorite app!

## How to run it

Firstly, **clone** the repository or **download** the source code. Then open the repository in you preferred **IDE** and **build the project**. Once the project's build is done, you should first run the eureka server, then all the microservices: usersService, offersRequestsService, contractService, feedbackService. We also have a detailed description of all endpoints in our [wiki](https://gitlab.ewi.tudelft.nl/cse2115/2021-2022/sem-group-03b/sem-repo-03b/-/wikis/Endpoint%20wiki).

In order to safely run our product on a production environment, you will need to create 2 `.env` files:
 - `userService/src/resources/.env` containing:
   - `JWT_SECRET`: the secret key used to sign the JWT token. (defaults to `secret`)
   - `ADMIN_PASSWORD`: the password of the admin that is created on first start. (defaults to `admin`)
   - `JWT_LIFETIME`: Optional. The lifetime of the JWT token in seconds. (defaults to `3600`)
 - `eurekaServer/src/resources/.env` containing:
   - `JWT_SECRET`: the secret key used to validate the the JWT token signed by the userService. (defaults to `secret`)
   - `JWT_LIFETIME`: Optional. The lifetime of the JWT token in seconds. (defaults to `3600`)
